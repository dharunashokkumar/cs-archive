<h2>Standalone Code Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>The code points of the Unicode blocks <a href="https://codepoints.net/box_drawing">Box
    Drawing</a> (U+2500 to U+257F) and <a href="https://codepoints.net/block_elements">Block
    Elements</a> (U+2580 to U+259F) cover
    most of your monospace command-line visualization needs.<pre><code>╭───────╮

<ul>
<li><a href="https://codepoints.net/U+2E2E">U+2E2E</a> REVERSED QUESTION MARK - the “irony
mark” to express irony/sarcasm. A useful character&#x2E2E;</li>
<li><a href="https://codepoints.net/U+D800">U+D800</a> to
<a href="https://codepoints.net/U+DFFF">U+DFFF</a> - surrogate code points. They are
only reserved to ease <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16">UTF-16
encoding</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://codepoints.net/U+FEFF">U+FEFF</a> ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE - it’s name
suggests, that it can be used like U+2060 WORD JOINER. And in fact the
latter was introduced to inherit its semantics. This is because U+FEFF had
become a special beacon called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark">byte order
mark</a>, that was placed on
the beginning of some UTF-8 files. In complying software (including many
text editors) this character is stripped from the start of a file and
handled as metadata. In non-complying software (like the PHP interpreter)
this leads to all sorts of fun behaviour.</li>
<li><a href="https://codepoints.net/U+FFFD">U+FFFD</a> REPLACEMENT CHARACTER - when a
character cannot be displayed (e.g., decoding an erroneous UTF-8 sequency),
this code point steps into the breach.</li>
<li><a href="https://codepoints.net/U+1D455">U+1D455</a> is missing. It would be an italic
small “h”. It was not encoded, because it would be identical to the Planck
constant ℎ (<a href="https://codepoints.net/U+210E">U+210E</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://codepoints.net/U+FF03">U+FF03</a> FULLWIDTH NUMBER SIGN - it is the 
"Japanese Hashtag" <code>＃</code>. Sites like Twitter accept it as equivalent to the 
regular <code>#</code> (<a href="https://codepoints.net/U+0023">U+0023</a>).</li>

<h2>Code Points that Affect Others</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://codepoints.net/U+202D">U+202D</a> and
    <a href="https://codepoints.net/U+202E">U+202E</a> - change the text direction.
    Relevant XKCD:</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/1137/"><img alt="" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/rtl.png" /></a>
* <a href="https://codepoints.net/U+FE0E">U+FE0E</a> VARIATION SELECTOR-15 - force
black-<em>&amp;</em>-white emoji. If this code point follows an emoji, an explicit
monochrome rendering of the emoji is requested (if the client supports it).
* <a href="https://codepoints.net/U+FE0F">U+FE0F</a> VARIATION SELECTOR-16 - force
colorful emoji. If this code point follows an emoji, an explicit colorful
rendering of the emoji is requested (if the client supports it).
* Diacritics and combining marks: There is a <a href="https://codepoints.net/search?gc=Mn">host of
characters</a>, that add
to the characters before. Those are called Combining Marks. Unicode
provides a <a href="http://unicode.org/faq/char_combmark.html">handy FAQ</a> on the
details, but in a nutshell: If you add one after a character, it is placed
on top of that previous one. So, <code>a + ̊ = å</code>. This <em>may</em> lead to all kinds
of funny problems, because for some combinations there are pre-composed
characters. Our little <code>å</code> here can also be encoded as U+00E5. You might
note, that while this has a length of one character, the combination of <code>a</code>
and combining ring has a length of two characters.</p>
<p>Of course, one can also do fun things with those characters like
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/113195">this answer</a> on StackOverflow.
* The <a href="https://codepoints.net/U+1F1E6..U+1F1FF">Regional Indicator Symbols</a>
U+1F1E6 to U+1F1FF resemble the 26 latin characters. They are used to
create flag emoji. Since the Unicode consortium didn’t feel like getting on
board with international politics, the solution to flags is to combine
these 26 characters to the respective ISO code for a country. Examples:</p>
