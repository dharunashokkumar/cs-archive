<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Testing is an essential phase in any product life cycle; whether if it's a food, cars, or software production line, the outcomes should match what's expected and meet, satisfy the need that we created the product for.</p>
<p>Having a solid base of understanding how the software components work and integrate with each other as well as gaining the skills of breaking things is an essential skill-set for any QA engineer. Software testing is the art of investigating the software and finding any unintended behavior that might generate undesired scenarios.</p>
<p>Below you can find the path for QA and software testing learning curve which you might need to start the journey.</p>
<h2>Test Plan Sample</h2>
<p>One of the most important documents to be generated by the QA team is the test plan, as the team will acting blindly without; not knowing the criteria, the starting point, or even when to perform different testing types can risk the whole delivery and causes bad code delivery.</p>
<p>Test plan sections and content can vary based on project and delivery nature, therefore, the attached test plan PDF is considered as a generic one that serves all software testing delivery purposes.</p>
<p>Attached PDF can be found here <a href="https://github.com/anas-qa/Quality-Assurance-Road-Map/blob/master/Test_Plan_Sample.pdf">test_plan_sample.pdf</a> for downloading.</p>
<h2>The Road Map</h2>

<h2>Advices</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don't trust a test code that you didn't see it failing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand software testing and do not jump into automation; personally, I classify automation as an efficient way to work a redundant task. make sure to properly design your test criteria and later on, you can automate to achieve the previous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automation is not more than documenting manually written tests and engineering it in a way the code will be readable, understandable, and reusable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that your testing code is actually testing something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your testing code shall not require testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>200~OK is not always okay; Do not rely only on server status while testing, getting 200 status for an unauthorized API call is risking your software security.</p>
</li>
</ul>
