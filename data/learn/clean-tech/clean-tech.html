<h3>Vegetation &amp; Agriculture</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aquaagro.smartcube.pk/">AquaAgro</a> | Karachi, Pakistan | 2018</li>
</ul>
<p>Provides solutions for precision farming, enabling farmers to monitor their crops and make better decisions. Their devices and platform can make predictions for irrigation scheduling, fertilizer requirement, pest attack prediction, and plant disease detection.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://boweryfarming.com">Bowery Farming</a> | New York, USA | 2015</li>
</ul>
<p>Their indoor vertical farms grow produce locally within cities with 95% less water, no pesticides, and 100x more productivity on the same footprint of land compared to traditional agriculture.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.droneseed.com/">Droneseed</a> | Seattle, USA | 2015</li>
</ul>
<p>A team including foresters, ecologists, and engineers focused on wildfire reforestation. They plant native trees &amp; vegetation using drone swarms and seed vessels developed to boost survival rates. As of 2020 they can propagate 40 acres in a day.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kheyti.com/">Kheyti</a> | India | 2015</li>
</ul>
<p>They implement low-cost farming solutions such as "Greenhouse-in-a-box" to help small farmers increase yield and predictability of produce.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://landlifecompany.com/">Land Life Company</a> | Amsterdam | 2013</li>
</ul>
<p>Their mission is to reforest the world’s 2 billion hectares of degraded land.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.peckas.com">Peckas Tomater</a> | Sweden | 2015</li>
</ul>
<p>Combined tomato and fish farm grown in a system where fish basin waste water nourishes tomatoes, and the tomato bed in turn cleans the water which goes back to the fish basins. Their fish is grown without antibiotics and the tomates does not need fertilizers.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://phytoponics.com/">Phytoponics</a> | UK | 2016</li>
</ul>
<p>Produces a commercial scale hydroponic growing system, which is cheaper and easier to install and maintain than traditional hydroponic systems. The goal is to bring the benefits of hydroponics (less water and land, more consistent yields), with a lower investment up front.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://solarfoods.fi/">Solar Foods</a> | Finland | 2017</li>
</ul>
<p>Produces Solein - a single-cell protein - from water, CO2 and electricity. It doesn’t require arable land or irrigation and isn’t limited by climate conditions. The original concept of Solein was born from a NASA space programme, and was further developed in the research projects of the Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd and the Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vultus.io/">Vultus</a> | Sweden | 2016</li>
</ul>
<p>Uses satellite imaging to save fertilizer usage up to 30%, and track crops health. This allows farmers to reduce their Nitrous Oxide emissions, a greenhouse gas that is 298 times more potent than CO2.</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.heurafoods.com/en-GB/home">Foods for Tomorrow / Heura</a> | Barcelona, Spain | 2017</li>
</ul>
<p>Created an ingredient named Heura which represents a new generation of plant-based proteins using innovative production techniques to get textures never seen on the vegetal realm. Heura needs 94% less water than to produce the same amount of veal protein and only 0.5kg of soy per kg produced.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/">Impossible Foods</a> | California, USA | 2011</li>
</ul>
<p>Their plant based burgers require 96% less land, 87% less water, and 89% less greenhouse emissions to produce than traditional burgers. Their mission is to produce plant based meat in order to reduce the impact of the meat industry on the environment.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.happycow.net/">HappyCow</a> | California, USA | 1999</li>
</ul>
<p>Reduce or avoid meat entirely by finding great vegetarian or vegan food all over the world.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://new.karma.life/">Karma</a> | Sweden | 2016</li>
</ul>
<p>Helps restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores selling their surplus food at a discounted price. As a result, users get food for less and businesses receive an additional revenue stream — all while reducing food waste.</p>
