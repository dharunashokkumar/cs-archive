<p><img src="https://covers.oreillystatic.com/images/9781680502527/cat.gif" width="180px" title="Elixir logo" /></p>
<p>Adoption is more than programming. Elixir is an exciting new language, but to successfully get your application from start to finish, you’re going to need to know more than just the language. You need the case studies and strategies in this book. Learn the best practices for the whole life of your application, from design and team-building, to managing stakeholders, to deployment and monitoring. Go beyond the syntax and the tools to learn the techniques you need to develop your Elixir application from concept to production.</p>

<p><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-ZwJtxOJL._AC_UY436_QL65_ML3_.jpg" width="120px"/></p>
<p>This book is a set of recipes grouped by topic that acts as a good reference to get ideas from or to quickly search for a solution to a problem. You will begin by launching an IEx session and using it to test some ideas. Next, you will perform various operations like loading and compiling modules, inspecting your system, generating a supervised app, and so on. Furthermore, you will be introduced to immutability, working with data structures, performing pattern matching, and using stream modules to generate infinite data sequences. You will learn about everything from joining strings to determining the word frequency in text. With respect to modules and functions, you will also discover how to load code from other modules and use guards and pattern matching in functions.</p>

<p>Elixir in Action teaches you how to solve practical problems of scalability, concurrency, fault tolerance, and high availability using Elixir. You'll start with the language, learning basic constructs and building blocks. Then, you'll learn to think about problems using Elixir's functional programming mindset. With that solid foundation, you'll confidently explore Elixir's seamless integration with BEAM and Erlang's powerful OTP framework of battle-tested abstractions you can use immediately. Finally, the book provides guidance on how to distribute a system over multiple machines and control it in production.</p>

<p>In this book, you will find descriptions of programs that you can write in Elixir. The programs will usually be short, and each one has been designed to provide practice material for a particular Elixir programming concept. These programs have not been designed to be of considerable difficulty, though they may ask you to stretch a bit beyond the immediate material and examples that you find in the book Introducing Elixir.</p>

<p>Official Elixir starting guide that will take you through the language foundations. You will also explore how to build projects with Mix and OTP, and it will introduce you to more advanvced techniques suchs as meta-programming.</p>

<p><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/cover/9781449369989/250w/" width="120px"/></p>
<p>Elixir is an excellent language if you want to learn about functional programming, and with this hands-on introduction, you’ll discover just how powerful and fun Elixir can be. This language combines the robust functional programming of Erlang with a syntax similar to Ruby, and includes powerful features for metaprogramming.</p>
