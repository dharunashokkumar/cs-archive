<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_development">Video game development</a> (or production) is a process of developing a video game by a single person or a team of developers, not necessarily professionals or employed by someone to do so. This list is focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_producer">game producer's</a> role - a person, who manages and orchestrates the game production process in multitude of ways.
