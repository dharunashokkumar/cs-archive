<p>Resources to help independent developers make money.</p>
<p>Making money from your own code has never been easier, but it's still hard. Here, I try to curate a list of resources to help everyone interested in making money from their digital products get inspired and give it a try. Be it monetizing side-projects, bootstrapping business ideas, etc.</p>
<p>Projects don't need to be big, actually, it's better if they are not, they just need to be profitable. They might provide a passive income after the initial bulk of work, and who knows, maybe even help you reach financial independence.</p>
<p>Going indie does have lots of lifestyle perks :)</p>
<p>All these resources might help inspire you and put you on the right track but in the end what matters is to <strong>MAKE and TRY stuff</strong>. So devour this content responsibly :)</p>
<p>Contributions are more than welcome.</p>
<p>by <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/mezood">@mezod</a></strong> (Doing things every day with <strong><a href="https://everyday.app">everyday.app</a></strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If [$], it means it's not free and probably means I haven't tried it but still decided to add it because of the several references.</li>
<li>This repo was once <a href="https://medium.com/@mezood/making-money-from-your-own-code-has-never-been-easier-but-its-still-hard-2242ddaae6a1">#1 on Github Trending</a>! :_)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/icepy">Icepy</a> translated this repo to <a href="https://github.com/icepy/awesome-indie">Chinese</a> :)</li>
</ul>
<!-- In general, I'd be wary of the several paid content-like products specially targeted to indie devs, so unless you can prove their value I'd like to keep them off of this list as much as possible. -->

It is a collection of interviews to successful developers about their products.
