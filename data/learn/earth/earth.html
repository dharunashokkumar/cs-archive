<h2>Carbon Reduction</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://1clickimpact.com/">1 Click Impact</a> - 1ClickImpact is a leading platform that helps businesses and individuals automatically capture carbon and plant trees using API or no-code integrations. Every carbon reduction is trackable in real time with verified data, project maps, and live planting sessions for full transparency. It makes measurable carbon removal and reduction a seamless part of your product or sustainability strategy.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org/">1% for the Planet</a> - A membership program for businesses and individuals, allowing them to donate 1% of their gross yearly profits or salary back to environmental nonprofits to create a healthier planet.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.beamproject.co/">Beam</a> - Make small automatic donations while you shop online, to support the cleantech startups trying to change the world. Clean Tech investment money has dried up over the years, so crowdsourcing is becoming the only option for many, and with a Chrome extension you can chuck in a dollar when you're buying other stuff.</li>
<li><a href="https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/">Carbon Pricing Dashboard</a> - Maps and statistics on regional, national, and subnational carbon pricing initiatives.</li>
<li><a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/">Climate Action Tracker</a> - See which countries are on track for the Paris Agreement or similar, and which countries are failing horribly. Hint: it's everyone but Morocco and The Gambia.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.climateworks.org/">ClimateWorks</a> - An NGO partnering with philanthropists to tackle the climate crisis. They seek to ensure investments have the maximum impact.</li>
<li><a href="http://climeworkspioneers.refr.cc/philsturgeon">Climworks</a> - Climeworks Direct Air Capture technology captures CO₂ from air, mixes the CO₂ with water used by a geothermal energy plant, then pumps it deep underground. Through natural processes, the CO₂ reacts with the basaltic rock – and turns into stone within a few years, permanently and safely. Iceland is one of several locations around the world that provide ideal conditions for our pioneering process. Subscribe monthly to offset a little bit of your footprint, and support the growth of this early stage technology.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.coolearth.org/">Cool Earth</a> - This charity was created to tackle climate change by reducing carbon emissions from rainforest loss.</li>
<li><a href="https://ecologi.com/?r=5d01f2ed12ae7a358b75fdd7">Ecologi</a> - Help the planet from your sofa, for less than a cheap bottle of wine per month. Watch your own forest come to life and offset your entire footprint for $6.50/€6 per-month. Then get your friends, family, business, and even your dog signed up!</li>
<li><a href="https://flightfree.co.uk/">Flight Free (UK)</a> - Aviation is the fastest growing contributor to greenhouse gas emissions at a time when we desperately need to reduce them. Pledge to go flight free in 2020.</li>
<li><a href="https://flightfreeusa.org/">Flight Free (USA)</a> - A grassroots campaign which asks people to agree not to fly in the year of 2020 – on condition that 100,000 others will also pledge to do the same.</li>
<li><a href="https://futureearth.org/">Future Earth</a> - Future Earth is a global research programme designed to provide the knowledge needed to support transformations towards sustainability. They focus on systems-based approaches, seeking to deepen the understanding of complex Earth systems and human dynamics across different disciplines.</li>
<li><a href="https://gikibadges.com/">Giki</a> - The Giki app provides accessible, independent, transparent information to help people change habits to live more sustainably. Our 14 badges cover sustainability, health and fairness.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goldstandard.org/take-action/offset-your-emissions">Gold Standard</a> - Offset carbon emissions by purchasing verified carbon credits from a variety of certified, environmentally friendly projects.</li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/sustainability/">Google Cloud Computing</a> - Google are a long way from perfect, but Google Cloud advertises 100% renewable energy. They don't <em>just</em> offset, they actually reduce the electricity usage too, and "strive to build the world’s most energy-efficient computing network by squeezing more out of every watt of power we consume." Their main rival, Amazon AWS, does not do that, and actively hosts oil and gas companies, who use the platform to find more places to dig. Switching to Google Cloud (or a host who in turn is on Google Cloud), is one of many ways to make your platform have less impact on the earth.</li>
