<p>A curated list of GitHub's awesomeness</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think GitHub is awesome? Contribute something to this list! It's easy, just have a look at the <a href="CONTRIBUTING.md">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>The awesomeness is currently organized into just a few different buckets: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#infomation-for-people-who-are-new-to-github">Infomation for people who are new to GitHub</a></li>
<li><a href="#resources-for-those-already-familiar-with-github">Resources for those already familiar with GitHub</a></li>
<li><a href="#tips-tricks-tools-and-add-ons-for-github-power-users">Tips, tricks, tools, and add-ons for GitHub power users</a></li>
<li><a href="#novel-uses-of-github">Novel uses of GitHub</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What is the <a href="https://github.com/phillipadsmith/awesome-github">Awesome GitHub</a> list? It's a collection of things that make <strong>GitHub</strong> one of the most amazing co-creation platforms in the world.</p>
<p>It is specifically focused on <em>GitHub</em>, and not on <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. Git is indeed awesome. And there would be no GitHub without Git. And yet, GitHub has become much more than a home to much of humanity's open-source code; it has become one of the world's most vivid examples of the power of mass collaboration.</p>
<p>All that to say, this list -- <a href="https://github.com/phillipadsmith/awesome-github">Awesome GitHub</a> -- is an attempt to document that aspect of what is awesome: everything that GitHub has become -- far beyond what Git is today, and beyond where GitHub started just eight years ago.</p>
<p>The inspiration for this list came from <a href="http://phillipadsmith.com/2015/09/github-gitdown.html">a session proposal</a> for the <a href="https://2015.mozillafestival.org/">2015 Mozilla Festival</a>. I later learned, serendiptiously, that the Mozilla Festival itself was using <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozfest-program">GitHub issues to manage the program</a> -- reviewing proposals, assign sessions to tracks and themes, and much more. Just one more example of how GitHub is being used to make awesome.</p>
