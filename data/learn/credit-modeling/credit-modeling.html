<h2>Credit Scoring</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221715004208">Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring: An update of research</a> - There have been several advancements in scorecard development, including novel learning methods, performance measures and techniques to reliably compare different classifiers, which the credit scoring literature does not reflect. This paper compares several novel classification algorithms to the state-of-the-art in credit scoring. In addition, the extent to which the assessment of alternative scorecards differs across established and novel indicators of predictive accuracy is examined.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1876735416300101">Classification methods applied to credit scoring: Systematic review and overall comparison</a> - The need for controlling and effectively managing credit risk has led financial institutions to excel in improving techniques designed for this purpose, resulting in the development of various quantitative models by financial institutions and consulting companies. Hence, the growing number of academic studies about credit scoring shows a variety of classification methods applied to discriminate good and bad borrowers. This paper aims to present a systematic literature review relating theory and application of binary classification techniques for credit scoring financial analysis.

In particular, simple methods typically yield performance almost as good as more sophisticated methods, to the extent that the difference in performance may be swamped by other sources of uncertainty that generally are not considered in the classical supervised classification paradigm.</p>
