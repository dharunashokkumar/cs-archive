<p>A list of things to read or watch that address these two questions: <strong>What is scalable CSS?</strong> and <strong>How do we create scalable CSS?</strong></p>
<p>By <em>scalable CSS</em>, I mean CSS that is
- capable of remaining effective, coherent, extendable, and maintainable as projects grow over time
- capable of being understood and worked on by any number of different people in a consistent, systematic way</p>
<p>Included are resources that articulate key principles and practices. The list is restricted to the articles that I consider the most <em>important</em> to read -- that is, the best explanations (of which I'm aware) for different approaches to the problems.</p>
<p><strong>If you know of a resource that should be added, please share! File an issue or a pull request.</strong></p>
<p>(There are plenty of other problems related to CSS: understanding how it works, using specific properties, accomplishing specific styles, achieving responsive design, boosting performance, etc. This list is strictly focused on the problem of creating scalable CSS.)</p>
<p><em>None of the sections present any kind of "ranking" or "suggested reading order." Just read them all.</em></p>

<h2>CSS Styleguides</h2>
<p>These styleguides articulate conventions and guidelines for authoring scalable CSS.</p>
<p>(I'm distinguishing <em>styleguides</em> from what I would call <em>pattern libraries</em>, which are references created to document and exemplify existing styles rather than guidelines for the authoring of the styles. Other people often use the term <em>styleguide</em> to refer to both or either of these reference types. I think pattern libraries are less specifically about scalable CSS, and more about a scalable frontend design and development workflow; so I'm not including resources related to pattern libraries.)</p>
