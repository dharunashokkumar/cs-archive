<ul>
<li>react, nginx, phoenix</li>
<li>GNU General Public License</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Codesandbox is an online IDE for web developers to quickly prototype and implement frontend applications using modern javascript frameworks like Vue, Preact, React etc Or even vanilla javascript.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/circleci/frontend">CircleCI</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>clojurescript, om, react</li>
<li>Eclipse Public License</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>CircleCI provides a continuous integration and deployment platform. The frontend is an impressive example of a large application built with the immutable data structures of clojurescript. The frontend integrates with pusher, intercom, d3, and google analytics and has a great example of navigation routing and communication via real-time events, websockets, and backend API servers. Its test suite is not that extensive but does provide a good example of how to test clojurescript/om apps using karma.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/PrecursorApp/precursor">Precursor App</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>clojurescript, om, react</li>
<li>Eclipse Public License</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Precursor is a highly interactive prototyping webapp. Its frontend is built from the ground up with clojurescript. The project has a simple enough routing and event passing system such that newer clojurescript developers could easily understand how routing in clojurescript applications can work. It is also full of many examples of how to build a component based frontend architecture that is part of an interactive graphics application i.e. where many components manipulate the HTML5 canvas or work with HTML5 APIs. </p>

<li>Apache 2.0 License</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The guardian is a news site with subscriptions, sign in, search, an admin interface and a series of middleman scala apps that handle communication between the static frontends and backend APIs. Its very fast and has a comprehensive test suite plus great examples of how to optimize large traditional websites for speed.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost">Ghost</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>node, express, ember</li>
<li>MIT License</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Ghost provides a simple publishing platform for bloggers. The code contains an emberjs client and node server backend that handle authorization, role management, tagging, blog posting, data persistence, and most things you'd expect from a quality blogging platform. The only thing that Ghost doesn't handle is i18n. It also contains a comprehensive test suite with both integration and unit tests that hit the whole ember/node stack.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq">Gitlab</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>ruby, rails, coffescript, redis, sidekiq,</li>
<li>MIT License</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Gitlab is a code collaboration tool. It is used by more than 100,000 organizations. It has just about everything you could imagine in a webapp, user management, user roles, OAuth, i18n, many modules designed for integrating with third-parties, deep git integration, and an extensive asynchronous task system using Sidekiq. It has an exemplary test suite using cucumber and rspec.</p>

<p>Discourse is a discussion platform or a modern take on the web forum. It has a very modular system built on top of rails and contains great examples of how to build an interactive frontend in ember within a rails application. It has an admin interface, signup/sign-in with Oauth for Google, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, and Github. It has extensive i18n, real time notifications, a plugin ecosystem, is SEO optimized, and is designed for tablet and mobile devices.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddit is a news platform for what's new and popular on the web. It is built in python and integrates with a lot of third party services: rabbitmq, memcached, cassandra, solr, and postgresql to name a few.
