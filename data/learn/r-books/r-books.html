<h4>Learning R <a href="www.amazon.com/Learning-R-Richard-Cotton/dp/1449357105/">[Amazon]</a></h4>
<p><img src="http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920028352/cat.gif" width="200px"/></p>
<p>Learn how to perform data analysis with the R language and software environment, even if you have little or no programming experience. With the tutorials in this hands-on guide, you’ll learn how to use the essential R tools you need to know to analyze data, including data types and programming concepts.</p>
<h4>Hands-On Programming with R <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hands-On-Programming-Write-Functions-Simulations/dp/1449359019">[Amazon]</a></h4>
<p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Hbowka72L._SX379_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="200px"/></p>
<p>Learn how to program by diving into the R language, and then use your newfound skills to solve practical data science problems. With this book, you' ll learn how to load data, assemble and disassemble data objects, navigate R's environment system, write your own functions, and use all of R's programming tools.</p>
<h4>The R Book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-Michael-J-Crawley/dp/0470973927">[Amazon]</a></h4>
<p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NNNTouQbL._SX371_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="200px"/></p>
<p>Very massive, hugely successful and popular text presenting an extensive and comprehensive guide for all R users. Covers wide variaty of R topics in great detail with very useful examples.</p>
<h4>R for Everyone: Advanced Analytics and Graphics <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Everyone-Advanced-Analytics-Graphics-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321888030">[Amazon]</a></h4>
<p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Jib4uNx3L._SX393_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="200px"/></p>
<p>Drawing on his unsurpassed experience teaching new users, professional data scientist Jared P. Lander has written the perfect tutorial for anyone new to statistical programming and modeling. Organized to make learning easy and intuitive, this guide focuses on the 20 percent of R functionality you’ll need to accomplish 80 percent of modern data tasks. Book's self-contained chapters start with the absolute basics, offering extensive hands-on practice and sample code. You’ll download and install R; navigate and use the R environment; master basic program control, data import, and manipulation; and walk through several essential tests. Then, building on this foundation, you’ll construct several complete models, both linear and nonlinear, and use some data mining techniques.</p>
<h4>R Cookbook <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cookbook-OReilly-Cookbooks-Paul-Teetor/dp/0596809158/">[Amazon]</a></h4>
<p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZWUV2DEyL._SX379_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="200px"/></p>
<p>With more than 200 practical recipes, this book helps you perform data analysis with R quickly and efficiently. The R language provides everything you need to do statistical work, but its structure can be difficult to master. This collection of concise, task-oriented recipes makes you productive with R immediately, with solutions ranging from basic tasks to input and output, general statistics, graphics, and linear regression.</p>
<h4>Learn R in a Day <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learn-R-Day-Steven-Murray-ebook/">[Amazon]</a></h4>
<p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4184UusYfJL._SX345_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="200px"/></p>
<p>'Learn R in a Day' provides the reader with key programming skills through an examples-oriented approach and is ideally suited for academics, scientists, mathematicians and engineers. The book assumes no prior knowledge of computer programming and progressively covers all the essential steps needed to become confident and proficient in using R within a day. Topics include how to input, manipulate, format, iterate (loop), query, perform basic statistics on, and plot data, via a step-by-step technique and demonstrations using in-built datasets which the reader is encouraged to replicate on their computer. Each chapter also includes exercises (with solutions) to practice key skills and empower the reader to build on the essentials gained during this introductory course. </p>
<h4>R Inferno <a href="http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf">[Online]</a> <em>Free</em></h4>
<p><img src="http://www.burns-stat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/R_inferno_cover.jpg" width="200px"/></p>
<p>"If you are using R and you think you’re in hell, this is a map for you."</p>
<p>This is a great introduction to several aspects of R programming. Loading data into R, iterating over data with loops &amp; logic statements, author even touches on creating packages. Nice and pretty thorough book on R. </p>
