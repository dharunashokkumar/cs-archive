    "description": "Developers and Open Source authors now have many services offering free tiers, but finding them all takes time to make informed decisions.",
    "note": "This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self-hosted software. To be eligible, a service must offer a free tier, not just a free trial. The free tier must be for at least a year if it is time-bucketed. We also consider the free tier from a security perspective, so SSO is fine, but I will not accept services that restrict TLS to paid-only tiers."
